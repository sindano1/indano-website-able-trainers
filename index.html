        <p>Able Trainers is a pet dog training company that focuses on accessibility in dog training for people with disabilities. Our training is least intrusive, minimally aversive, reward based, and based in the science of positive reinforcement dog training.</p>
        <p>There are plenty of resources on how to teach a visually impaired dog or a dog with three legs, but there are far fewer if the human end of the leash needs accommodations. We strive to advocate for a new gold standard in accessible dog training.</p>
        <p>Private lessons slots, both virtual (anywhere) and local in-person (central to northern New Jersey), are OPEN! All bodies are welcome, people with disabilities and non-disabled people alike! If you need a dog trainer, please reach out via messenger or email at abletrainersllc@gmail.com .</p>

          <td>Able Trainers provides two types of in person instruction!
            Client Instruction - Able Trainers teaches you how to train your dog. With a combination of demonstration and instruction, we work to enhance your skills to handle your own pup.
            Trainer Instruction - Also known as day training, the trainers of Able Trainers themselves work your dog in a location of your choosing (ie. your home or a location near your home that you frequent), with or without you present.

          <td>Training Walks are for the dog that you want to be able to take with you on the go without stress from either end of the leash. Able Trainers will take your dog on a 45-minute (travel time not included) walk to a variety of places ranging from your neighborhood walks, hikes, local parks, coffee shop patios, and more. We will work on loose leash walking, settling skills, public manners, cue generalization, mental stimulation, and more! After each walk we will let you know how the walk went and how to keep up your dogâ€™s skills. An in person consultation is required for training walks. </td>
          <td>Group classes and walks will occasionally be offered at a centralized, public location to clients for them to work on particular skills of that day. Group classes will be limited to 5 dogs (space dependent) and clients will have access to real time feed back and troubleshooting from Able Trainers.</td>
